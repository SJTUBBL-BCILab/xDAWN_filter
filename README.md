# xDAWN_filter
The repo is used to upload the codes for xDAWN method and corresponding demos. This repo is updated by members of Laboratory of Biomechenics, Institute of Robotics, School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
## NOTE
Remember to pull each time before editing codes to avoid potential conflicts with other members.
## Reference and validation
The codes of xDAWN referred to the article of Rivet, B. et al. 2009. Specific details of the mathematical formulation could be found in "xDAWN algorithm to enhance evoked potentials: application to brain-computer interface" (DOI:10.1109/TBME.2009.2012869)

The codes of this repo have been verified on ErrP public dataset BNCI ([BNCI 2010](http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets) -> 22. Monitoring error-related potentials). Our results are consistent with the paper titled "Single trial detection of error-related potentials in brainâ€“machine interfaces: a survey and comparison of methods" (DOI:10.1088/1741-2552/acabe9).
## Implementation
- Download the source file **'xDAWN_class.m'**
- Copy the file **'xDAWN_class.m'** to your work path or include the path in the Matlab
- Use this method as a spatial filter or a pre-processing method.
